## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:
- Developing a part-based method for object detection in remote sensing imagery.
- Implementing weak supervision to lessen the dependency on extensive labeling.
- Improving the overall object detection performance in the realm of remote sensing.

## Methodology

The methodology employs a weakly supervised setting to train the model, leveraging part-based detection techniques. This approach seeks to reduce the requirement for heavily annotated data, which is a common bottleneck in training models for remote sensing object detection.

## Results

The results demonstrate a significant improvement in object detection performance, showcasing the potential of part-based methods under weak supervision. The approach notably alleviates the challenges posed by exhaustive labeling, paving the way for more efficient and effective object detection within remote sensing imagery.

## Future Work

The success of this project beckons further exploration into weakly supervised and part-based methods for object detection, potentially extending the methodology to other domains and further refining the approach to achieve even higher levels of performance.
