## Project Overview

`Goal`: Create a Cocktail-bar Searching IOS app that allows user to search for their favorite bar on a specific location, and save their results. For myself, I use Chicago as the location.

`Initial Proposal`: I want to create an app that allows users to search for a cocktail bar in the Chicago area and it can see the reviews of that bar. Right now I am just thinking the review will be based on my personal experience. It is something like yelp, but it only focuses on the cocktail and alcohol parts. I want to implement what we learned from using MapKit to do that. The function will include searching a cocktail bar and finding the review about it, and making it into a favorite list. I am still looking for a way to put some restaurant and bar information to the app, and also how the users can search that. Also, the professor gives me some recommendations on implementing notification and navigation, which means when someone is walking on the street, and if one bar in the app is near them, the app will pop out the notification. I am still trying to figure out how to accomplish this part. Not Sure how much I can accomplish with this app though.

## User Feedback & Optimization:

- Conducted 50+ user acceptance testing and incorporated feedback to improve app usability and user satisfaction
- Implemented Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling using BERT with Pytorch to enhance the recommendations by accurately comparing the stores against the user preferences for personalized experiences
- Utilized a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict user preferences over time, based on their search history, visit patterns, and spending to enhance recommendation accuracy


## Results:
- Developed the DRUNK, a cocktail bar searching IOS app, from ground-up using Swift and SwiftUI in Xcode
- Integrated the YelpAPI and Core Location framework to retrieve data on cocktail bars in a user-specified location
- Designed responsive UI allowing users search specific bar and save favorite bars, engineered backend with CoreData
